<p>The Institute of Lexicography was founded on 5 October 1950 as a scientific institution devoted to encyclopedistics and lexicography. The founder of the Institute was the Croatian writer, lexicographer, and erudite Miroslav Krleža, who brought together professionals from all scholarly fields and initiated encylopedic-lexicographical activity in modern Croatian society. The Institute was founded in Zagreb, which already had a strong lexicographical tradition, including experience with the <em>Croatian Encyclopedia</em> (1941–45), whose editor-in-chief, Mate Ujević, became Krleža's assistant.</p>
